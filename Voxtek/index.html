                This chubby, sweet looking Angel is called Abel, also known as one of Adam's sons. He's definitely my favourite with his slightly prideful, cheery and caring personality, and there is a divide in the fandom as to whether people also like him or not. Voiced by Patric Stumph, Abel has a personality that awes most of the audience, with his large pale yellow wings, a little pink, white and yellow marching band outfit, a matching hat with white feathers, and a halo that seems to never be completely straight. Abel cares deeply for his friends and the people he loves, actively showing sadness when Lute reminds him in episode two season two, that his father didn't even like him. Although the Angel can be seen as nonconfrontational, he also shows a small amount of pride when Sera tells Lute that she is not in charge of the Angelic Army, and that Abel is instead. This perfect balance of slight bashfulness and pride create such an amazing character that is Abel, (especally since he was voiced by the lead singer of Fallout Boy, one of the most iconic emo bands out there). Personally, I'm hoping that if they show Cain, he will be voiced by Gerard Way, lol.
