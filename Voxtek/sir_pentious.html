                Baxter. The mad scientist. Little freak. Smart boy. These are just some of the names our lovable fish demon friend has. Coming in at an estimate of 4'11, Baxter is a bio scientist who (formerly) worked at VoxTek. He has incredible science and used to be lab partners with the now redeemed Sir Pentious. Baxter becomes a reoccuring character in season two of Hazbin Hotel, assuming that Vaggi was his best friend near the end of the season because she folded his blankets at a perfect 45 degree angle so they were more tuckable. Nevertheless, this mad scientist is close to my top favourite, with his dry humour, smart thinking, and witty comments, although Abel still takes the cake... For now...
