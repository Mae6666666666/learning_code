                Carmilla Carmine. a powerful overlord known for building angelic weapons that have the ability to kill angels.
                She has two daughters, and not a lot of screentime. Her colour palette mainly consists of grey, black, and white
                with a hint of red. Her movements definitely give off ballerina vibes considering it looks like she's always on her
                tiptoes. Overall, Carmilla is pretty cool, and helpful too, learning that agreeing to Vox's "demand", wasn't the right
                way to solve things when he wanted to attack heaven's gates.
