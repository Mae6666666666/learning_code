                    Angel Dust. The ultimate star in hell. Anthony is a sinner in hell with his appearance based off a spider
                    due to his "web of crime" when he was alive. In the beginning, he shows no change or desire to be redeemed
                    at the Hazbin Hotel, however, more in season 2, he shows significant improvements, even getting a comment from
                    Husk, mentioning "the only person down here to be redeemed is Pentious, and Angel on a good day". He has great
                    character development, and I got so surprised when he was revealed to be a spy (not by choice). I can't wait to see more
                    of him in season 3!
