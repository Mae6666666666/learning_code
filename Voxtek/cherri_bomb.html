                Cherri Bomb. a sinner in hell with a sparky and explosive personality. She is known for her love of bombs,
                having a rather punk like appearance and only one eye. She's very close to her friend, Angel Dust, and later
                in the season, has a crush on Pentious, although it isn't completely confirmed, instead sinuated. I personally
                think Cherri is such a cool character, and she's one of my favourites too. I wish she had more screentime along
                with Abel and Baxter.
